							AFROTC, you'll learn the fundamentals of effective leadership and apply those lessons in real-world environments and
							exercises. AFROTC cadets earn commissions as active-duty Air Force officers upon graduation and go on to serve in
							rewarding careers across the globe.</p>

						<h2>What does a typical training day look like?</h2>
						<p>Training occurs on Tuesdays and Thursdays. A typical day begins at 6:00 AM at the Campus Recreation Center for an hour-long physical training (PT) session. Cadets then shower and change into the uniform of the day before heading off to ROTC classes taught by active-duty cadre starting at 8:00 AM. Freshman and sophomore classes are an hour long, once a week while classes for juniors and seniors meet twice a week for an hour and a half.</p>
						<p>At 12:00 PM, leadership laboratory (LLAB) begins. LLAB is led by junior and senior cadets and overseen by cadre. LLAB applies lessons learned from class in a hands-on training environment. Subjects include marching and drill, small unit tactics, group leadership problems (GLPs), field training exercises, guest lectures, and more. LLAB concludes at 1:15 PM. After LLAB, cadets are free to attend regular college classes or head back to their dorms.</p>

						<h2>What happens after graduation?</h2>
						<p>After completing all Air Force ROTC and academic degree requirements, cadets accept a commission as second lieutenants in the Air Force, appointed by the President of the United States. The length of your initial service commitment depends on your career. Most officers have a four-year active-duty service commitment. Pilots have a 10-year active-duty service commitment, and both Combat System Officers and Air Battle Managers have a six-year service commitment upon completion of their respective trainings. Nursing graduates accept a commission in the Air Force Nurse Corps and serve four years on active duty after completing their licensing examination.</p>

						<h2>Where can I learn more about AFROTC scholarships?</h2>
